# Software Requirements

## Vision

### What is the vision of this product?

This product is intended to allow users to submit orders through a Slack workspace and receive updates on their order.

### What pain point does this product solve?

This product is able to capture user input from Slack using an AWS Chat bot and submit their input to the system automatically. This automates the process, preventing the need for human support personnel. By using Slack, it also prevents the need for a traditional frontend webpage.

### Why should we care about your product?

This functionality is very common for many different business cases, such as:

- An e-commerce customer ordering process, with notifications for order updates
- A support ticketing system, with notifications for support ticket updates
- An application submission system, with notifications for application updates
